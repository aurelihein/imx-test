NOTICE: please check clkcount often

1.1: With USB Hub connected at OTG Port boots up
1.1.1 The u-disk connected at HUB
check clk refcount is 1
plug out u-disk
check clk refcount is 0
plug out hub cable
check clk refcount is 0
plug out Micro-AB cable
check clk refcount is 0


1.1.2 Nothing is needed at HUB
After booting up, and check if clock refcount is 0
plug in usb mouse to see if works OK
plug out usb mouse to see if clock refcount is 0
plug out HUB to see if clock refcount is 0

1.2: Check u-disk connect/disconnect at hub
Plug in HUB
check clk refcount is 0
plug in u-disk

check clk refcount is 0
re-do u-disk connect/disconnect 10 times, the u-disk needs to be
recognized at every time.

1.3: With hub connected, do system suspend/resume
u-disk is connected, do "echo mem > /sys/power/state"
after resume, the u-disk should be existed.
without u-disk connection, after system resume,
the u-disk needs to be recognized after connection.

1.4 Redo 1.1-1.3 with USB mouse

| Expected Result |
Without kernel dump, without clock mismatch
