|Name | Description

| Summary |
IEEE1588 timestamp test

| Automated |
No

| Kernel Config Option |
CONFIG_FEC_1588=y

| Software Dependency |
FEC driver

| Non-default Hardware Configuration |
Two boards are needed which are connected back to back through ethernet.

| Test Procedure |
.Test step:
. Two boards are connected directly through ethernet.
. One board run as master and the other runs as slave,
  and run the same commands in the two boards.
. Creat node: mknod /dev/ptp c 232 0
. Open ethernet: ifconfig eth0 10.193.20.180 up
. Run the IXXX stack: ./ptp_main -d -o -m -l -w -z

| Expected Result |
IEEE1588 must be convergent.
It is acceptable that the convergent range from -150ns to 150ns.
It is good performace that the average convergent value is about 20ns.
