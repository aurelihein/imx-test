camera and display required.

| Test Procedure |
Check that /dev/video0 exists. If it does not exist, load the camera driver with the command:

modprobe mxc_v4l2_capture

modprobe CAMERA_MODULE (CAMERA_MODULE should be replaced by the camera module on the related platform, e.g. ov3640_camera should be used here on MX51)

Check again for /dev/video0. If it is not there, the camera driver has not loaded successfully and the test has failed.

Type the following command line in a writable directory. The 50 frames of video from the camera will be captured in the file "test.yuv" at a resolution of 352x288 with no rotation and a frame rate of 30 fps. The format will be YUV420.

 mxc_v4l2_capture.out -iw 352 -ih 288 -ow 352 -oh 288 -r 0 -c 50 -fr 30 test.yuv

| Expected Result |
There should be no errors or warnings. The file "test.yuv" will be created with a size of 7603200.

To display the video at the resolution of 176x144, use the command line below (a different resolution may be used depending on display size):

 mxc_v4l2_output.out -iw 352 -ih 288 -ow 176 -oh 144 -r 0 -fr 30 test.yuv

Verify captured file contents match viewfinder and that the image is clear and the colors correct.
