camera and display required.

| Test Procedure |

Check that /dev/video0 exists. If it does not exist, load the camera driver with the command:

 modprobe mxc_v4l2_capture

modprobe CAMERA_MODULE (CAMERA_MODULE should be replaced by the camera module on the related platform, e.g. ov3640_camera should be used here on MX51)

Check again for /dev/video0. If it is not there, the camera driver has not loaded successfully and the test has failed.

Type the following command line in a writable directory. A still image at the resolution of 640x480 will be saved in the file "still.yuv" in the format YUV422 planar.

 mxc_v4l2_still.out -w 640 -h 480 -f YUV422P?


Note: YUV420 is the fommat defined by sensor(UYVY,YY), and needs to convert to YV12 format, then it can be viewed by common tool.

| Expected Result |
No errors or warnings seen.


The file "still.yuv" is created with the size of 614400.

The image can be viewed with:

 mxc_v4l2_output.out -iw 640 -ih 480 -ow 176 -oh 144 -l 100 -f 422P still.yuv

The image should be the correct image, clear and with the correct colors.
