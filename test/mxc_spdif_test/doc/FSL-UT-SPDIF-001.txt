| Software Dependency |
N/A

| Non-default Hardware Configuration |
M-Audio Transit USB sound card

| Test Procedure |

. Setup M-Audio Transit USB sound card and install M-Audio Transit driver on PC
. Connect coaxial line between ARD and M-Audio transit
. Startup WaveLab, open a test wav file: audioXXkYYS.wav to play in loop
. call amixer to get rx sample rate by "RX Sample Rate" sound controller.
command as:
amixer cget numid=6,iface=PCM,name='RX Sample Rate',device=1
. Meanwhile, on board use following command to record one wave file, and
play it back on the audio stereo codec device (the recorded stream will be
heard from headset)

 $ arecord -D hw:[card id],[pcm id] -t wav -c 2 -r [sample rate in Hz] -f
S24_LE \| aplay -D "plughw:0,0" -t wav

Note: The sample rate argument in the arecord command must be consistent with
wav file playing on WaveLab.

| Expected Result |
Hear audio that is captured from S/PDIF being looped back out stereo codec.
