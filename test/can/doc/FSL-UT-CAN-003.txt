. Active CAN interface

  ip link set can0 up type can bitrate 125000

. Run cansend to transmit one message.

  cantest can0 1F334455#1122334455667788

. Check the data that KVASER CAN recieved.

.Procedure B
. Get a FlexCAN loop-back connector or cable lines and connect it between CAN1 and CAN2.

. Active CAN interface

  ip link set can1 up type can bitrate 125000

. Put can0 into receive mode in a background process

  cantest can0&

. Send test packet from CAN1 to CAN0

  cantest can1 1F334455#1122334455667788
