|Name | Description

| Summary |
Frame buffer basic test for display.
The framebuffer driver should be able to easily add new displays to
the system including timings, refresh, resolution, formats, via tables in the driver.

| Automated |
YES (But manual observation is required to confirming correct updates on display panel)

| Kernel Config Option |
 CONFIG_FB=y
 CONFIG_FB_MXC=y
 CONFIG_FB_MXC_EDID=y
 CONFIG_FB_MXC_SYNC_PANEL=y
 CONFIG_FB_MXC_LDB=y
 CONFIG_FB_MXC_HDMI=y
 ...

| Software Dependency |
N/A

| Non-default Hardware Configuration |
ifdef::imx6q[]
The fb0 and fb1 are used for tests, fb0 is background framebuffer, and
fb1 is foreground overlay framebuffer.
endif::[]

| Test Procedure |
Frame buffer test for display.

.Features tested:
* Basic fb operation
* Set background/foreground to 16 bpp fb
* Global alpha blending
* Color key test
* Framebuffer Panning
* Gamma test

 $ /unit_tests/mxc_fb_test.out
 Usage: execute directly.

 Example:
 root@freescale /unit_tests$ ./mxc_fb_test.out
 Opened fb0 and fb1
 Set the background to 16-bpp

 Screen size = 1572864
 Set the foreground to 16-bpp
 Testing global alpha blending...
 Fill the FG in black
 Fill the BG in white
 Alpha is 0, FG is opaque
 Alpha is 255, BG is opaque
 Color key enabled
 Color key disabled
 Global alpha disabled
 Set the background to 16-bpp
 Pan test start.
 Pan test done.
 Set the background to 16-bpp
 Pan test start.
 Pan test done.
 Gamma test start.
 Gamma 0.800000
 Gamma 1.000000
 Gamma 1.500000
 Gamma 2.200000
 Gamma 2.400000
 Gamma test end.

| Expected Result |
The test should pass without any failure messages, and the display on panel
should be correct.

For each test, a sequence of updates should be reflected on the screen.  For
almost all tests, the text printed out in the debug console describes the image
that should be observed on the screen.
